Problem: Answer each of the following questions briefly. The questions are based on the 
following relational schema:
=============================================================================================
Emp(eid: integer, ename: string, age: integer, salary: real)
Works(eid: integer, did: integer, pcttime: integer)
Dept(did: integer, dname: string, budget: real, managerid: integer)

1) Give an example of a foreign key constraint that involves the Dept relation. What
are the options for enforcing this constraint when a user attempts to delete a Dept
record?

Given the ER data above Dept has a foreign key relationship with the Works entity.  
Since it is possible for a company to close a department but keep the employees, 
they might be moved to another department you would not want a cascade on delete 
when deleting a Department record.  

The constraint on Dept would be:
foreign key (did) references Works

The constraint on Works would be:
foreign key (did) references references Dept
foreign key (eid) references references Emp

No cascade on delete in either case.

2) Write the SQL statements required to create the preceding relations, including
appropriate versions of all primary and foreign key integrity constraints.
Emp:
----------------
primary key eid

Works:
---------------
foreign key (did) references references Dept
foreign key (eid) references references Emp

Dept
--------------
primary key did
foreign key (did) references Works

3) Define the Dept relation in SQL so that every department is guaranteed to have a manager.
create table Dept (
    did integer not null, 
    dname string, budget real, 
    managerid integer not null,
    primary key (did)
)

4) Write an SQL statement to add John Doe as an employee with eid = 101, age = 32 and salary = 15,000.

insert into Emp values (101, 'John Doe', 32, 15000);

5) Write an SQL statement to give every employee a 10 percent raise.

update table Emp set salary = salary * 1.1;

6) Write an SQL statement to delete the Toy department. Given the referential
integrity constraints you chose for this schema, explain what happens when this
statement is executed.

delete from Dept where dbname = 'Toy'

Given the constraints I assumed, the employees would still be in the database, but 
they would not be part of that department.

Problem: First, take a brief look at the attached .txt files: student.txt, majorsin.txt,
book.txt, cites.txt and buys.txt. They contain data as comma-separated records. It is
better to have an idea what the fields look like before you create any table. Create a
database with the name UNIVERSITY. Then create tables in UNIVERSITY according to the
following schemas:

Student(Sid; Sname;GPA)
MajorsIn(Sid;Major)
Book(BookNo; Title; Price)
Cites(BookNo;CitedBookNo)
Buys(Sid;BookNo)

The relation MajorsIn stores students and their majors. A student can have multiple
majors, but we also allow that a student can have no major. A tuple (b,c) in the relation
Cites indicates that the book with book number b cites the book with book number c.
Note that a book may cite multiple other books. Also, a book does not have to cited. The
keys of the relations are the underlined attributes.
Define data types for the various attributes as well as primary and foreign key constraints.
Where appropriate, add “ON DELETE CASCADE” statements with the foreign key
constraints.
Hint: As a feature, MySQL does not allow you to write foreign key constraints like FOREIGN
KEY (BookNo) REFERENCES Book even if there is a field named 'BookNo' in Book. You must
use: FOREIGN KEY (BookNo) REFERENCES Book(BookNo).
Then use MySQL's LOAD statement to load data from the four .txt files. An example LOAD
statement is like: LOAD DATA INFILE ‘/path/to/student.txt’ INTO TABLE Student FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',';
Validate the data in each tables using the SELECT statement (Explanation of how SELECT
works will be discussed in the next section, for now just run the below queries to ensure
data is loaded correctly)

SELECT * FROM table_name;

I used sql inserts to load the dat instead of "load data infile". I also ran the select * 
on the tables and could see the data.

Connection id:    12
